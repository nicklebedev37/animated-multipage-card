animated-multipage-card
=======================

The app for running congratulations over the multiple monitors/device screens in realtime.

To run the app:

0. go to the directory and run 'npm install'.
1. execute 'node src/server.js'.
2. open page 'http://localhost:8888/host.html'.
3. open a few pages (as many as you like) 'http://localhost:8888/client.html'.
4. press 'connect' on all client pages. Press the connect button on the pages where the animated congratulation should run first.
5. press 'start' on the host page.
6. observe the running congratulation. It should look similar to:

<todo: insert img>

The app is the sort of prototype and therefore contains bugs :), but it does its primary purpose very stable and well.
